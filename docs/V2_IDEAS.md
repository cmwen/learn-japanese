### "Kanji-Go" - V2 Brainstorm & Feature Ideas

**Theme 1: Expanding the Core Knowledge**

*   **Feature: Kanji Learning Module**
    *   **Description:** This is the most logical next step. Introduce the first and most essential set of Kanji characters (e.g., the 100-120 characters required for the JLPT N5 level).
    *   **Details:**
        *   For each Kanji, display its meaning, On'yomi (Chinese reading), and Kun'yomi (Japanese reading).
        *   Show animated stroke order diagrams to teach correct writing.
        *   Provide example vocabulary words using each Kanji.
    *   **User Value:** Unlocks the next layer of the Japanese language, allowing users to start reading and understanding simple sentences.

*   **Feature: Themed Vocabulary Packs**
    *   **Description:** Expand the vocabulary beyond the initial ~100 words by offering curated, thematic word packs.
    *   **Details:** Users could activate packs like "Food & Restaurant," "Shopping," "Transportation," or "Common Anime Phrases."
    *   **User Value:** Allows for personalized learning paths tailored to a user's specific interests or needs.

**Theme 2: Enhancing the Learning Experience**

*   **Feature: Audio Pronunciation**
    *   **Description:** Integrate native speaker audio clips for all Kana, vocabulary, and Kanji.
    *   **Details:** A small speaker icon next to each item would play the correct pronunciation when clicked. This would require sourcing audio files and ensuring they are cached for offline use.
    *   **User Value:** Crucial for developing correct pronunciation and listening skills, a major weakness of purely text-based apps.

*   **Feature: A "True" Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**
    *   **Description:** Upgrade the V1 flashcard quiz to use a proper SRS algorithm.
    *   **Details:** Instead of just shuffling cards, an SRS algorithm intelligently schedules items for review at increasing intervals (e.g., 1 day, 3 days, 1 week) based on user performance. This is scientifically proven to be more effective for long-term memorization.
    *   **User Value:** Makes studying dramatically more efficient and effective.

**Theme 3: Increasing Engagement & Personalization**

*   **Feature: Gamification & Motivation**
    *   **Description:** Add elements to make learning feel more like a game.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Streaks:** Track consecutive days of study.
        *   **Points/XP:** Award points for correct answers.
        *   **Badges:** Unlock achievements for milestones (e.g., "Hiragana Master," "10-Day Streak").
    *   **User Value:** Increases user motivation and encourages consistent, daily practice.

*   **Feature: User Customization & Themes**
    *   **Description:** Allow users to personalize the look and feel of the app.
    *   **Details:** A simple settings panel could offer a "Dark Mode," different font choices, or alternative color schemes.
    *   **User Value:** Improves user comfort and makes the app feel more personal.
