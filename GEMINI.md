# Gemini Development Log for Kanji-Go

This document details the interaction and contributions of Google Gemini in the development of the Kanji-Go PWA.

## Role of Gemini

Gemini acted as a multi-faceted assistant throughout the project, fulfilling roles such as:

*   **Product Owner:** Clarifying requirements, defining MVP scope, and brainstorming V2 features.
*   **Business Analyst/Solution Designer:** Translating product requirements into a technical design specification, including architecture, file structure, and data models.
*   **Experienced Svelte Developer:** Providing guidance on technology stack choices (Svelte/Vite), identifying potential challenges, and debugging implementation issues.
*   **Implementation Assistant:** Generating boilerplate code, setting up project structure, and assisting with component creation and integration.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Performing Playwright-based verification of implemented features against requirements. When a developer starts implementation, the local development server can be assumed to be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`, and Playwright tool can be used to inspect the results.

## Key Contributions

*   **PRD Creation:** Collaborated on defining the initial Product Requirements Document, including core features, goals, and multilingual support.
*   **Technical Design:** Developed the detailed technical design specification, outlining the Svelte/Vite architecture, module breakdown, and data structures.
*   **Project Scaffolding:** Set up the initial project structure, including `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `svelte.config.js`, and core directories/files, establishing a module-based project structure.
*   **Debugging:** Identified and resolved critical JavaScript and Svelte-related errors during development, including dependency conflicts and reactivity issues.
*   **Feature Implementation:** Assisted in the creation and integration of key Svelte components like `Navigation.svelte`, `LanguageSwitcher.svelte`, `KanaChart.svelte`, `VocabularyList.svelte`, and `KanaQuiz.svelte`, along with data modules (`kana.js`, `kanji.js`, `vocabulary.js`), internationalization (`i18n.js`), and Svelte stores (`stores.js`).
*   **Data Population:** Provided comprehensive Hiragana, Katakana, and basic vocabulary data.
*   **Deployment Setup:** Configured GitHub Actions for automated deployment to GitHub Pages, leveraging the `build` script defined in `package.json`.
*   **Documentation:** Ensured project documentation (`PRD.md`, `TECH_DESIGN.md`, `V2_IDEAS.md`) was organized and up-to-date.
*   **Kanji Stroke Order SVG Generation:** Developed a script (`generate_kanji_svgs.sh`) to automate the process of downloading and integrating Kanji stroke order SVGs from the KanjiVG project, ensuring repeatability and ease of adding new Kanji.
*   **PWA Integration:** Assisted with the setup of Progressive Web App features, including `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js`.
