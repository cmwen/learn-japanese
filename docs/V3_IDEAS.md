## State Management and Portability

### Export/Import State via URL

Allow users to export their application state (language, theme, mastery progress, gamification progress) as a URL parameter. This would involve:

*   **Compression and Encoding:** Compressing the state data (e.g., using LZ-string) and then Base64 encoding it to embed in a URL query parameter.
*   **URL Generation:** Providing a button in settings to generate this URL for easy sharing or transfer between browsers/devices.
*   **URL Parsing and Import:** The application should check for this URL parameter on load, decode and decompress the state, and then update the Svelte stores accordingly.

### Clear State Action

Add a "Clear State" button in the settings to reset all persistent Svelte stores to their initial default values. This action should include a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental data loss.
