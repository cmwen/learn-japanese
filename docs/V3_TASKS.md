    - [ ] Create placeholder content for a few articles across different categories.
- [ ] **Landing Page (`/explore`):**
    - [ ] Implement the "Fact of the Day" banner (rotating content).
    - [ ] Design and implement the grid/list layout for article categories.
    - [ ] Display article lists within each category.
- [ ] **Article View:**
    - [ ] Implement the standard article layout (title, image, body text).
    - [ ] Ensure good readability (font size, line height, contrast).
    - [ ] Integrate any interactive elements (e.g., embedded maps, image galleries) if applicable.
- [ ] **Contextual Pop-ups/Tooltips:**
    - [ ] Identify key vocabulary/kanji within cultural articles that should trigger tooltips.
    - [ ] Implement a mechanism to wrap these terms with a Svelte component that displays a tooltip on hover/tap.
    - [ ] Ensure tooltips are non-intrusive and provide a "Read More" link to the full article.

#### 5. Input Methods & Tools (within Explore Section)
- [ ] **Content Structure:**
    - [ ] Define a data structure for input method guides (e.g., JSON files with OS/device, steps, troubleshooting).
    - [ ] Create placeholder content for a few guides (e.g., Windows, macOS, iOS).
- [ ] **Guide List:**
    - [ ] Implement a list of guides, clearly labeled by operating system/device.
- [ ] **Guide Detail Page:**
    - [ ] Implement step-by-step instructions with clear language.
    - [ ] Integrate placeholder images/screenshots for visual guidance.
    - [ ] Implement a dedicated troubleshooting section.

#### 6. Learning & Progress Tracking (Progress Section)
- [ ] **Data Storage:**
    - [ ] Design and implement `IndexedDB` schema for storing user progress data (Kana, Kanji, Vocabulary mastery, quiz performance, learning streak, notes).
    - [ ] Create utility functions for reading from and writing to `IndexedDB`.
- [ ] **Dashboard View:**

#### 7. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [ ] **Performance Optimization:**
    - [ ] Optimize image assets for web.
    - [ ] Consider lazy loading for content-heavy sections.
    - [ ] Implement efficient rendering for long lists (e.g., virtual scrolling if needed for notes or vocabulary).
- [ ] **Accessibility (A11y):**
    - [ ] Ensure all new UI elements are keyboard navigable.
    - [ ] Add appropriate ARIA attributes for screen reader compatibility.
    - [ ] Maintain sufficient color contrast.
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n):**

    - [ ] Verify proper display of translated content.
- [ ] **Error Handling & User Feedback:**
    - [ ] Implement consistent toast messages or other feedback mechanisms for user actions (e.g., save, delete, import/export success/failure).
    - [ ] Implement robust error boundaries for critical components.
- [ ] **Testing:**
    - [ ] Write unit tests for new Svelte components and utility functions.
    - [ ] Write end-to-end tests (e.g., using Playwright) for critical user flows (import/export, navigation, note taking).
