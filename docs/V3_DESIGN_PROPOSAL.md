## Revised V3 UI/UX Design Proposal: Focused on Core Learning & Engagement

The goal remains to seamlessly integrate new features, maintaining a clean, intuitive, and mobile-first design, now with a clearer path for implementation.

### 1. Global Navigation & Information Architecture

The proposed navigation structure still holds, as it provides clear homes for the new content types.

*   **Current:** Home, Kana, Kanji, Vocabulary, Settings
*   **Proposed:**
    *   **Home/Dashboard:** (Existing)
    *   **Learn:** (New, consolidates grammar, lessons, and potentially quizzes)
    *   **Explore:** (New, for cultural insights and input methods)
    *   **Progress:** (New, for tracking and personal notes)
    *   **Settings:** (Existing, with additions)

### 2. Feature-Specific UI/UX Designs (Revised)

#### A. State Management & Portability (Settings) - **REVISED**

*   **Location:** Within the existing "Settings" section.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   **"Data Management" Sub-section:**
        *   **"Export Data" Button:** A clear button labeled "Download My Progress (JSON)."
            *   On click: Triggers a file download of the user's state as a JSON file. A brief "Download started!" toast message.
        *   **"Import Data" Section:**
            *   **File Input:** A standard file input element labeled "Upload Progress File (JSON)" with a clear "Choose File" button.
            *   **"Load Data" Button:** Appears after a file is selected.
            *   Validation: Provide feedback if the selected file is not a valid JSON or doesn't contain expected data.
            *   Confirmation: "Are you sure you want to overwrite your current progress with this file? This action cannot be undone." dialog before importing (with "Cancel" and "Confirm" buttons).
    *   **"Reset Application" Sub-section:** (No change)
        *   **"Clear All Data" Button:** Prominently displayed, perhaps in red, with a warning icon.
            *   Confirmation Dialog: "You are about to clear ALL your learning progress and settings. This action cannot be undone. Are you sure?" (with "Cancel" and "Confirm" buttons).

#### B. Language Mechanics & Grammar Features (New "Learn" Section) - **REVISED**

*   **Navigation:** A new main navigation item "Learn."
*   **Landing Page ("Learn"):**
    *   **Structure:** A card-based layout, each card representing a major grammar category (e.g., "Particles," "Verb Conjugation," "Adjectives," "Sentence Patterns").
    *   **Progress Indicators:** Each card could display a small progress bar or a checkmark if all sub-topics within are completed.
*   **Grammar Topic Detail Page:**
    *   **Layout:** Clean, readable content area, designed like an article.
    *   **Headings:** Clear, hierarchical headings (e.g., "Particle „ÅØ (wa)").
    *   **Explanations:** Concise text, easy to understand.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Japanese sentence (large font).
        *   Furigana (toggleable, or always visible).
        *   English translation.
        *   Optional: Audio play button for pronunciation.
    *   **Nuances/Tips:** A distinct section (e.g., a callout box) for "Notes on nuances, exceptions, and common mistakes."
    *   **Mini-Quiz:** At the end of each topic, a simple multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank quiz for self-assessment. (This is a simple, non-interactive element that can be implemented with static questions and answer checking).

#### C. Cultural & Contextual Information (New "Explore" Section) - (No change)

*   **Navigation:** A new main navigation item "Explore."
*   **Landing Page ("Explore"):**
    *   **"Fact of the Day" Banner:** A prominent, dismissible banner at the top of the "Explore" page (or even the Home page) displaying a rotating fun fact.
    *   **Article Categories:** A grid or list of categories (e.g., "Demographics," "Culture," "History," "Language Nuances").

*   **Contextual Pop-ups/Tooltips:**
    *   **Integration:** When a user hovers over a specific vocabulary word or kanji in other sections (e.g., Vocabulary List, Kanji Chart), a small, non-intrusive tooltip could appear.
    *   **Content:** "Did you know? [Brief cultural fact related to the word/kanji]." with an optional "Read More" link to the full article in the "Explore" section.

#### D. Input Methods & Tools (Within "Explore" or "Settings") - (No change)

    *   **Troubleshooting:** A dedicated section for common issues and solutions.

#### E. Learning & Progress Tracking (New "Progress" Section) - (No change)

*   **Navigation:** A new main navigation item "Progress."
*   **Dashboard View:**
    *   **Overall Mastery:** Prominent progress bars for "Kana Mastery," "Kanji Mastery," "Vocabulary Mastery" (e.g., 75% Hiragana, 60% Katakana, 150/200 Kanji, 500/1000 Vocabulary).
    *   **Learning Streak:** A clear display of the current learning streak (e.g., "üî• 7-Day Streak!").
